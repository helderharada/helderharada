**helderharada/helderharada** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working in japan but not with IT.
-  I'm currently learning python and javascript. And I already know css and html.
-  I try to collaborate fairly in all my work.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with learning the English language. Does anyone qualify? :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... I don't know, things I like. And I can do well.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
      helder.o.harada@gmail.com
      or
      contatomeru@hotmail.com
